* redesign the hastable for autotext ( the value should be an array)
* handle the way of executing a function from snooper (use thread_pool?)
* use (g_hash_table_replace) instead (g_hash_table_insert) (autox.c)
* support match (, )
* customizable completion regular patterns
* Glib 2.6: use g_stat() instead of stat(), g_unlink() instead of unlink()
* Move template_rescan_cb() from func_grep.c to menu.c (make it static)
* Optimize usage of GET_BIT
* implement message box (not statusbar_message);
* windows/close all others
* gtk2.4: gtk_combo_* => gtk_combo_box_*
* Optimized document.c::(gap_command)
* capture: \usepackage{foobar}
* increase the length of command recognized by collector
* (Outputbox) scroll the output as option.
For 'cat', scrolling will slow down Winefish.
* Join list: pcre, glib, gtk+
* common/exported syntax hilight
* optmized the use of GtkTextIter
* Backspace doesnot start autocompletion
* project: various main files support
* update chars: should add 'backspace'
* autocompletion: customizable 'start/stop' regular expresion
* code folding
* bookmarks by name/groups
* import/export hilight configuration
* bookmarks moveup/do
* dropdown autotext list
* dropdown menu should have the background color customizeable.
* color scheme
* TOOLS
	- latex
	- metapost
	- dtx [*.dtx, *.ins]
	- style [latex package]
	- metafont
	- normal file
	- bibtex
	- xml file
* expandsion: file extension [*.tex and *.dtx]
* METAFONT support
* indent the contents for \(sub){0,2}section*, \chapter*, etc
* set READNONLY for files with '-r' permission
* date format support
* creating a new project should create the new files too. Currently,
we cannot enter the new basefile for the new project
* start folder sometime failed
* Completion word, not only latex command [like KILE, KDevelop]
* Add more reconigzer for LaTeX Error
!File ended while scanning use of \eqref
* METAPOST support
* Add autotext to completion [see KDevelop]
* READONLY files couldnot be changed ?
* Use <xml> to describe system of menus [as recommendation of GTK doc.]
* test: autotext <:(> autocompletion
* closing Winefish if the last file of project is removed.
... i don't like it... stupid sometimes
* plugins support ? [see gedit :)] See Bluefish Mailing List
* add grep tools (see kdevelop)
* add IDLE to collect users input macros [ or *cache* support ]
* win32 port [but i hate win32]
* Hyperref support for *label* and *ref*
* Image for preference page of `autox'
* File Types: dtx, cls, context (+detection)
* Join C++ Forum
* xml version of latex,ams packges [DOCUMENTATION]
* add support for bib.
* tools: bibtex, makeindex
* intelligent syntax highlight for latex [special design]
* fixbug: UNDO/REDO for autoclosingtag()
* latex/custom menus
* syntax: for sty, for tex (differs?)
* optimize expandsion (pre-calculate the basedir, basename)
* MenuGO: goto the main document (basedir/basefile) of project
* split the job (output commands); sometimes we needs the output before
* add: set file in READONLY MODE
* syntax problem: [currently NOT implement this feature]
if we define "group-single"="{[^{}]+}"
then (unfortunately), the percent in \foo{asdf %}
willNOT be treated a comment starter.
* the source specials ARENOT ALWAYS of the form %c%b.tex
Sometime, it should be: %c<foodir>%b.tex
Determination of <foodir> is hard problem?
==> SO IN THIS VERSION OF WINEFISH, the files we include
should be located in the same directory with the BASEFILE
* add DATE format (dynamic/preference) [like Win32/EditPlus]
this feature is not very important but necessary.
should implement this in some minor version
* some behaviour from Abiword: image previous IN FILE CHOOSER (very good)
* add drop-down list in the toolbar [See Abiword]
* hotkey to to5Aggle Bookmark
