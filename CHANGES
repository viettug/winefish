Winefish 1.3.2.5 (Summer Release)
=================================

* BUGS fixed:
- Major BUG#{57,54,50}
- Minor BUG#{62,59,58,56,55,49,48,47,46,44}

* (NEW) ConTeXt support:
- Beta/testing. Require "--with-context" while "./configure"ing
- Filetype, hilight
- Autocompletion [ \start...\stop, \begin...\end ]
- Table wizard [ natural table only ]
  As I do*NOT* know conTeXT, your requests are highly appreciated!

* Autocompletion:
- FIXED: BUG#55
- (NEW) Collector: new command/environment will be added
  automatically to the database [ ~/.winefish/words_s ]
  *WARNING* the file is bigger day by day :)
  FIXME: Winefish eats also '\\notacommand'
  TODO: add to Preferences Page [ A page for session words ]
- If the result of completion contains *ONLY* one command:
= The popup menu will be hidden automatically
  [ if the user's input equals to the result in popup menu ]
  It may be activated when you press CTRL + Space :)
= You can hide the popdown menu by the (Page)Up/Down keys
- Duplicate entries will be ignored when Winefish starts.
  TODO: do this *ONLY* once -- as the feature may slow down Winefish.
  An option may be added -- bigger Winefish :(
- The autocompletion starts (automatically) *ONLY* if at least three
  characters are typed (includes the backslash: \xy).
  Anytime, press CTRL + Space!
- The mininum width of popdown menu was enlarged [ 64 => 100 ]

* Outputbox:
- Behavior changed: If a tool is set 'Show all output', the box will
  *NOT* scroll automatically. Why? 'Show all output' may produce too many
  lines and scrolling in this case will slow down the fish. 'cat' is an
  example. An option may be added in Winefish-1.3.2-7. Within the fix,
  'cat' is as fast as you want :)
- For maximum space, the header of treeview was hidden.
- 'Close' icon was placed on the upper left corner [ more beautiful :) ]
- When main GUI is resized, the outputbox is resized too.
  FIXME: not correct if window state changes

* Autotext:
- Autoindent supported. Winefish will append the 'indent' string
  to any '\n' characters of after/before string. I think this is GOOD,
  but it may make you tedious ;)

* Hilight Syntax:
- Updated [ almost new syntax|color ]
- Fresh color
- Bugs fixed
- (NEW) conTeXt hilight syntax [ testing ]

* LaTeX code:
- Removed preformat items for: split, cases environment
- Table: the '&' character will be vetically aligned
  TODO: edit table's items within the wizard

* GUI:
- Default mode is "Experience". See below.
- Sidebar, Main Toolbar, LaTeX Toolbar, Custom Menu are hidden by default
- The values of 'View/*' will be stored as global session variable.
  This mean that they are (re)stored per session.
- Last change of 'Document/Line numbers' will be stored as session variable.
- Menu reordered: '/Edit/{Save Settings, Preferences}' => '/?/*'
  FIXME: cannot add '/?/tearoff1'
- There are*NOT* any submenus in '/External/'

* The fish:
- (NEW) splash screen [ Keep It Simple and Stupid ]
- The fish is still blue. I need another one.
  [ So the fish does*NOT* live in the Splash ]

* Documentation:
- (NEW) Added 'doc/TIPS'
- The files 'doc/*.pdf' are removed from source directory --
  we may create a new package 'winefish-doc'.
  FIXME: The documation is 'out-of-date'.

* Translation:
- vi: typo fixed [ Thanks to VnPenguin at http://vnoss.org/ ]
- it: updated

* Stuff:
- Disabled empty QuickBar warning.
  This may be considered as a TIPS -- addto documentation.
- Code optmized: use (strncmp) instead of (strcmp) some places
- (NEW) hilight: CHANGES, TODO, context
  I donot why these are needed. May be fun?
  At least I can read my CHANGES very very easily :)
- Updated: THANKS, TODO, AUTHORS, README, and CHANGES :)
- Added ROADMAP
